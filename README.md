This project started as a quick experiment using GPT-4o with canvas, but it got too lazy after reaching around 300 lines of code. I then switched to a Vite `vanilla-ts` template and completed the rest using Claude 3.7 Sonnet in Cursor.

The `main.ts` file was entirely generated by LLMs - it's unoptimized and probably unmaintainable, but that's part of the fun.

Remarkably, it works pretty well despite being completely hallucinated by AI. Maybe we don't need human developers after all? ğŸ˜‰
